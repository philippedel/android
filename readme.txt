1. Get the registration page front end working (so that we can see all 3 input boxes)
2. Successful login or registration should take the user to a blank homepage (this will be the homepage with menu later)
3. Build database for the friends/confidant functionality
4. Create the friends page taking into account who is logged in, and the friends and confidants they have in the friend's database
5. Add menu button to the friends page and the homepage, so that the user can move around these pages from there
